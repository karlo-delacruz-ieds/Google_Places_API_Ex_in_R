# Google Places API Application Example
---
I would like to share this code that I used in my research entitled *Product Assortment Plan for Convenience Stores based on its Nearby Establishments*. In my study, I need to collect nearby establishments surrounding the stores within 100 meter radius. Thanks to **Google Places API**, I manage to get nearby establishment information in a given list of store coordinates. 

Before you could run the code, you need to have a **Google API Key** and install R libraries used in the code.

I would like to mention that I used the free trial version (worth $300). Please monitor your use of the key to prevent unwanted charges in your bank account 

I hope this code could help you!
